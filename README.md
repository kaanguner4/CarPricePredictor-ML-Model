# 🚗 CarPricePredictor – ML-Based Used Car Price Estimation System

## Project Overview

CarPricePredictor is a complete machine learning deployment project that predicts the market value of used cars based on real-world vehicle attributes.  
The system combines a trained CatBoost regression model with an interactive Streamlit web application to provide instant car price estimations.

This project represents a full pipeline from raw dataset → preprocessing → model training → evaluation → saving the trained model → deploying a real-time prediction app.

The goal is to create a professional and user-friendly vehicle valuation tool similar to platforms like Kelley Blue Book or AutoTrader.

## ✅ What We Built in the Last Week

Over the last week, the project evolved step-by-step into a production-style application:

### 1. Dataset Preparation & Feature Engineering
- Loaded a real used-car dataset (used_cars.csv)
- Cleaned price and mileage columns by removing currency symbols and formatting
- Standardized model names
- Extracted meaningful features such as:
  - vehicle age
  - engine information
  - turbo presence
  - hybrid flag

---

### 2. Machine Learning Model Development

We selected CatBoostRegressor due to its strong performance with mixed categorical + numerical data.

Key aspects:
- Handles categorical variables effectively without heavy encoding
- Produces stable results on structured tabular car datasets

The target variable was transformed using logarithmic scaling to improve performance:

- Model predicts log(price)
- Final output is recovered using:

final_price = np.expm1(predicted_log)

---

### 3. Model Training, Evaluation & Exporting

A full training script (test_and_save.py) was used to:

- Split train/test data
- Train CatBoost regression
- Evaluate performance with MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Save the final trained model:

model.save_model("car_price_model.cbm")

This exported file is later used directly inside the web app.

## Streamlit Web Application

The prediction system is deployed through a professional UI built in Streamlit.

### Features of the Web Interface

Users enter vehicle information through structured sections:

### Basic Info
- Brand
- Model
- Model Year
- Mileage
- Fuel Type

### Appearance & Condition
- Exterior / Interior Color
- Clean Title status
- Accident history
- Transmission type

### Technical Details
- Horsepower
- Engine size (L)
- Cylinders
- Turbo presence

## Prediction Workflow (How It Works)

When the user clicks Calculate Price, the following pipeline runs:

### Step 1: Input Collection
The user inputs are collected through Streamlit forms.

### Step 2: Feature Dictionary Construction

user_input = {
    "brand": brand,
    "model": model_name,
    ...
    "age": 2026 - year,
    "is_turbo": int(is_turbo),
    "is_hybrid": ...
}

### Step 3: Conversion to DataFrame

CatBoost expects structured input:

input_df = pd.DataFrame([user_input])

### Step 4: Price Prediction

res_log = model.predict(input_df)[0]
final_price = np.expm1(res_log)

### Step 5: Display Results

The application outputs:

✅ Estimated price  
✅ Confidence range (±5%)

st.metric("Estimated Value", f"${final_price:,.2f}")
